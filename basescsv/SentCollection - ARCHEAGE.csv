rt @nekrage: @archeage how about those still not receiving emails with the auth codes?,-1

@archeage holds the price for best head start release. never in my life have i seen a better headstart than this! truly amazing. #sarcasm,-1
not to beat a dead horse but just curious; are anyone elses patron timers on the login screen wrong? @archeage #archeage,-1

@archeage getting only a black screen when trying to log on my char on kyprosa. is this s server issue or should i be worried about my char?,-1
so excitied to finally play archeage!,1
@archeage you know what would help server ques? an afk kick system. from what i can tell there isnt one. otherwise having a blast.,-1
i understand that @archeage has all hands full right now - but 2;2k player queue? o_o we had 1;2k with 1h wait on weekend.,-1
"@archeage main story quest bugged;unable to get gilda stars.stuck on this quest ""a strange request"" in dawnsilver. eu eanna server",-1
@archeage this sword is amazing *--------* http://t.co/embb3wwpwo,1
@_laughter @_grimsley @grakulen believe me when i tell you; archeage is the next big mmo. and ive played em all.,1
officially addicted to #archeage,1
tomorrow is the launch of #archeage soooo stoked! best mmorpg! #mmorpg,1
watching @kelaisnow play the #archeage pre release makes me really excited to try it out when it goes live tomorrow :o,1
i think if i can fix my mindset of thinking i can only focus on one mmo i could enjoy archeage. maybe just play where the wind takes me.,1
playing an arena or 2 while waiting for lag to finish in archeage: http://t.co/ts1xc1hdvs,-1
@archeage the gods have disconected you ; the gods have disconected you; the gods have disconected you......,-1
@_laughter im actually in the same situation! but im hoping archeage pleases me enough to help me not pay for wow.,-1
@archeage help with this please ;(,-1

@archeage 25min queues and this is only headstart; good luck to any f2p once the game goes live; quicker to queue for the new iphone,-1
@archeage how about fixing the servers you have?!?!?!?!?,-1
@archeage how about giving double labour when queue ?,-1
hmmmm; what have i been up to. played the archeage stress test. accidentally missed the open - teach me to read... http://t.co/zafksxwoqm,-1
@archeage 1:30 to wait in queue for a black screen.... game dont load.... i return in queue for 2hours... thats inacceptable !,-1
labor points in archeage are a big deal. patron gets 1440 a day; non 288 a day. thats huge! makes me happy for my status as a patron.,1
@scapes any fix for archeage not getting past the splash art? after the first two words highlight; it stops loading,-1
@archeage instead of only one server make more than one..... still 2000 people queuing on eanna... please.....,-1

@archeage spent £100 to get the 4 day head start and i have still not had it. when you let me play what are you giving me to compensate?,-1
archeage got me hooked woah,1
@archeage all the time that you spend in the queue and you paid for patron should be refunded; as you overload the servers by purpose,-1
@archeage yeh you need to fix your game abit more instead of worrying about flying boats,-1
higher larceny gives less of a chance to leave behind footprints wtb more coinpurses please! #archeage,-1
@dryaxx @archeage @trionworlds the idea is cool;and the content is there; i just feel weird about it; who knows i might download it and try,1

@thebillmurphy @archeage flawed as any mmo; but will find success with a dedicated following from a grossly under served niche.,1
@hartsman @thebillmurphy @archeage i havent had enough time to play either but i am enjoying what i have played!,1
@grakulen @thebillmurphy @hartsman @archeage two hours to get in; and within five minutes; two of them got bounced back to a 3 hour queue.,-1
@grakulen @thebillmurphy @hartsman @archeage #noneformethanks. hope its a good game tho.,1
@hartsman @thebillmurphy @archeage game takes waaay too long to load up though. is this a server issue or something with the client?,-1
@stafunoob i played archeage a little bit in beta; and i think its definitely worth trying,1
@grakulen @thebillmurphy @hartsman @archeage from what i played of beta: meh.,-1
@archeage hey thanks for new servers; whoever did that is awesome. :d extremely impressed!!,1
