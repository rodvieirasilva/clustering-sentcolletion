i know ive bitched about archeage. but it is a extremely fun mmo. once fixed im sure it will rock. but im still pissed at the servers;2;
@zelibeli i know this feeling! i was trying to plant olives before bed (6pm for me since i work at midnight) #archeage;2;

@wowthatsawful hey there that can be resolved by logging out and logging back in.;2;

#archeage announced 2 new servers 1 for na and 1 for eu. only on the website. no one knew.;2;
well doesnt look like ill be playing archeage after all. still in early access.;3;

@archeage i exited to char select my chars were gone went back to server select and it worked again but now im in a 3hr queue;2;
@archeage i really wish the labor system was a little different holds hardcore players back a lot. not to mention its account wide.;2;
#archeage just announced 2 new servers have opened! hopefully all the land wont be gone by tomorrow. -);2;
the newest #archeage servers are: inoch and aier. roll there tomorrow if you want a chance at land and less queues! :-);2;

@therevtastic i installed archeage to prepare and it slowed my whole computer down so much d: i uninstalled and it was fine again >.<;1;
why make me wait 45 mins in a queue to get online then just show me a black screen when i enter. so i have to exit & queue again #archeage;1;
@archeage will you ever fix the authentication code thing?? i want to buy your game and you wont let me. ffs;2;
@archeage yay.. now tell us about that compensation.;2;
@archeage finally;2;
@archeage its a start...but one server per region isnt enough.;2;
@archeage fix your authentication code now;2;
gah wow destiny madden archeage. taking the day off for gaming tomorrow. going all in on destiny/archeage methinks.;2;
@archeage so... how long is the "seperate" queue for banned accounts exactly? or do those emails land in the trashcan directly?;1;

@archeage no french / german / spanish serv incoming ?;2;
#archeage launch tomorrow! :d can’t wait! :d;2;
@archeage if i had not already made my character i would change to the new one;2;
ooooooo @archeage ! not sure your announcement of two new servers is going to go down well! but hopefully itll ease populations;2;
think my new favorite time killer while i wait on videos to render is camping the archeage auction house. :3;2;
only 24 hours til @archeage will be flooded with new players again. #hype;2;
@archeage cant get past the queue to buy a new char slot and get into the new server. screwed again. gg trion thanks for the warning.;2;
@hartsman @archeage why can i not login to the new server!!!!! i only have 2 characters total on 1 server! wtf???;2;
@archeage what good is a new server if i cant connect to it? i have only 2 chars total on one server...;2;

i want this stupid orange donkey in #archeage so bad. i already used my credits on like 10 chests but no luck. http://t.co/aocfvgabv0;1;
@archeage 900 people in the queue. when it will get better?;2;
@archeage after queue and entering the game i only get a black screen..;2;
brace yourselves @archeage! tuesday is coming! #officiallaunch #mmorpg #archeage #queuequeue http://t.co/n52dllgqhq;3;
#archeage is ridiculous. and addictive.;2;
@archeage holds the price for best head start release. never in my life have i seen a better headstart than this! truly amazing. #sarcasm;2;
not to beat a dead horse but just curious are anyone elses patron timers on the login screen wrong? @archeage #archeage;2;
@itmejp trion added two new archeage servers! http://t.co/nyuwjm2pqx;2;
@archeage getting only a black screen when trying to log on my char on kyprosa. is this s server issue or should i be worried about my char?;2;
so excitied to finally play archeage!;1;
@archeage you know what would help server ques? an afk kick system. from what i can tell there isnt one. otherwise having a blast.;2;
i understand that @archeage has all hands full right now - but 22k player queue? o_o we had 12k with 1h wait on weekend.;2;

@archeage this sword is amazing *--------* http://t.co/embb3wwpwo;2;
@_laughter @_grimsley @grakulen believe me when i tell you archeage is the next big mmo. and ive played em all.;3;
officially addicted to #archeage;2;
tomorrow is the launch of #archeage soooo stoked! best mmorpg! #mmorpg;3;
watching @kelaisnow play the #archeage pre release makes me really excited to try it out when it goes live tomorrow :o;3;
i think if i can fix my mindset of thinking i can only focus on one mmo i could enjoy archeage. maybe just play where the wind takes me.;3;
playing an arena or 2 while waiting for lag to finish in archeage: http://t.co/ts1xc1hdvs;3;
@archeage the gods have disconected you  the gods have disconected you the gods have disconected you......;2;

@archeage 25min queues and this is only headstart good luck to any f2p once the game goes live quicker to queue for the new iphone;3;
@archeage how about fixing the servers you have?!?!?!?!?;2;
@archeage how about giving double labour when queue ?;2;
hmmmm what have i been up to. played the archeage stress test. accidentally missed the open - teach me to read... http://t.co/zafksxwoqm;3;
@archeage 1:30 to wait in queue for a black screen.... game dont load.... i return in queue for 2hours... thats inacceptable !;2;
labor points in archeage are a big deal. patron gets 1440 a day non 288 a day. thats huge! makes me happy for my status as a patron.;2;
@scapes any fix for archeage not getting past the splash art? after the first two words highlight it stops loading;2;
@archeage instead of only one server make more than one..... still 2000 people queuing on eanna... please.....;2;
countdown to archeage! http://t.co/huzwhdbjxh;2;

@archeage spent £100 to get the 4 day head start and i have still not had it. when you let me play what are you giving me to compensate?;3;
archeage got me hooked woah;2;
@archeage all the time that you spend in the queue and you paid for patron should be refunded as you overload the servers by purpose;2;
@archeage yeh you need to fix your game abit more instead of worrying about flying boats;2;

@hartsman @thebillmurphy @archeage game takes waaay too long to load up though. is this a server issue or something with the client?;2;

@grakulen @thebillmurphy @hartsman @archeage from what i played of beta: meh.;3;
@archeage hey thanks for new servers whoever did that is awesome. :d extremely impressed!!;2;
