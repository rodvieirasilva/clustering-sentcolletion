@archeage paying 150$ and i cant play :/;0;
@wowthatsawful hey there that can be resolved by logging out and logging back in.;0;

@archeage so are all us servers also all in ques of like 2000+ or is that just us eu people;0;
@archeage @scapes when i try to select another server than the one i come from its greyed out connect ? i have 6 unlocks..;0;
@archeage i am so scared of tomorrows launch the 4 servers for the whole of eu except russia;0;
@archeage any way to transfer our characters to the new server or we have to start from scratch?;0;
#archeage announced 2 new servers 1 for na and 1 for eu. only on the website. no one knew.;0;
well doesnt look like ill be playing archeage after all. still in early access.;0;
gaming company trion worlds hit with another series of ongoing ddos attacks this weekend. http://t.co/rdegpth6wd via @gamesonnet;0;
@archeage i exited to char select my chars were gone went back to server select and it worked again but now im in a 3hr queue;0;
@archeage i really wish the labor system was a little different holds hardcore players back a lot. not to mention its account wide.;0;
#archeage just announced 2 new servers have opened! hopefully all the land wont be gone by tomorrow. -);0;
the newest #archeage servers are: inoch and aier. roll there tomorrow if you want a chance at land and less queues! :-);0;
do i want to play archeage? yes. do i want to spend the money on it? no.;0;
two new servers coming up for archeage. inoch for na and aier for eu. #archeage;0;

@strawlie dragon age and then archeage tomorrow hehehe;0;
@therevtastic i installed archeage to prepare and it slowed my whole computer down so much d: i uninstalled and it was fine again >.<;0;
why make me wait 45 mins in a queue to get online then just show me a black screen when i enter. so i have to exit & queue again #archeage;0;
@archeage will you ever fix the authentication code thing?? i want to buy your game and you wont let me. ffs;0;
@archeage yay.. now tell us about that compensation.;0;
@archeage finally;0;
@archeage its a start...but one server per region isnt enough.;0;
@archeage fix your authentication code now;0;
gah wow destiny madden archeage. taking the day off for gaming tomorrow. going all in on destiny/archeage methinks.;0;
@archeage so... how long is the "seperate" queue for banned accounts exactly? or do those emails land in the trashcan directly?;0;

@kokauh97 @archeage @temeezer and for our missing items ? i dont know... maybe we can have... something like what we paid for ?;0;
@archeage if only i had a headstart. going to replace minecraft with archeage! 😊;0;

@archeage no french / german / spanish serv incoming ?;0;
#archeage launch tomorrow! :d can’t wait! :d;0;
@archeage if i had not already made my character i would change to the new one;0;
ooooooo @archeage ! not sure your announcement of two new servers is going to go down well! but hopefully itll ease populations;0;
think my new favorite time killer while i wait on videos to render is camping the archeage auction house. :3;0;
only 24 hours til @archeage will be flooded with new players again. #hype;0;
@archeage cant get past the queue to buy a new char slot and get into the new server. screwed again. gg trion thanks for the warning.;0;
@hartsman @archeage why can i not login to the new server!!!!! i only have 2 characters total on 1 server! wtf???;0;
@archeage what good is a new server if i cant connect to it? i have only 2 chars total on one server...;0;

@archeage 900 people in the queue. when it will get better?;0;
@archeage after queue and entering the game i only get a black screen..;0;
brace yourselves @archeage! tuesday is coming! #officiallaunch #mmorpg #archeage #queuequeue http://t.co/n52dllgqhq;0;
#archeage is ridiculous. and addictive.;0;
@archeage holds the price for best head start release. never in my life have i seen a better headstart than this! truly amazing. #sarcasm;0;
not to beat a dead horse but just curious are anyone elses patron timers on the login screen wrong? @archeage #archeage;0;
@itmejp trion added two new archeage servers! http://t.co/nyuwjm2pqx;0;
@archeage getting only a black screen when trying to log on my char on kyprosa. is this s server issue or should i be worried about my char?;0;
so excitied to finally play archeage!;0;
@archeage you know what would help server ques? an afk kick system. from what i can tell there isnt one. otherwise having a blast.;0;
i understand that @archeage has all hands full right now - but 22k player queue? o_o we had 12k with 1h wait on weekend.;0;

@_laughter @_grimsley @grakulen believe me when i tell you archeage is the next big mmo. and ive played em all.;0;
officially addicted to #archeage;0;
tomorrow is the launch of #archeage soooo stoked! best mmorpg! #mmorpg;0;
watching @kelaisnow play the #archeage pre release makes me really excited to try it out when it goes live tomorrow :o;0;
i think if i can fix my mindset of thinking i can only focus on one mmo i could enjoy archeage. maybe just play where the wind takes me.;0;
playing an arena or 2 while waiting for lag to finish in archeage: http://t.co/ts1xc1hdvs;0;
@archeage the gods have disconected you  the gods have disconected you the gods have disconected you......;0;

@archeage 25min queues and this is only headstart good luck to any f2p once the game goes live quicker to queue for the new iphone;0;
@archeage how about fixing the servers you have?!?!?!?!?;0;
@archeage how about giving double labour when queue ?;0;
hmmmm what have i been up to. played the archeage stress test. accidentally missed the open - teach me to read... http://t.co/zafksxwoqm;0;
@archeage 1:30 to wait in queue for a black screen.... game dont load.... i return in queue for 2hours... thats inacceptable !;0;
labor points in archeage are a big deal. patron gets 1440 a day non 288 a day. thats huge! makes me happy for my status as a patron.;0;
@scapes any fix for archeage not getting past the splash art? after the first two words highlight it stops loading;0;
@archeage instead of only one server make more than one..... still 2000 people queuing on eanna... please.....;0;
countdown to archeage! http://t.co/huzwhdbjxh;0;

archeage got me hooked woah;0;
@archeage all the time that you spend in the queue and you paid for patron should be refunded as you overload the servers by purpose;0;
@archeage yeh you need to fix your game abit more instead of worrying about flying boats;0;

@hartsman @thebillmurphy @archeage game takes waaay too long to load up though. is this a server issue or something with the client?;0;

@grakulen @thebillmurphy @hartsman @archeage from what i played of beta: meh.;0;
@archeage hey thanks for new servers whoever did that is awesome. :d extremely impressed!!;0;
